## ðŸ”¹ Key Enhancements

This fork builds on the excellent foundation of RooFlow with several key improvements:

- **Brazil Workspace Integration**: Native support for Brazil 
- **Simplified Setup Process**: Single script installation with both local and remote repository modes
- **Workspace Detection**: Automatic identification of Brazil workspaces

## ðŸ”¹ Installation

### One-Line Setup

The easiest way to install RooFlow in your environment is with this one-line command:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinodismyname/RooFlow/refs/heads/main/config/setup-roo.sh | bash -s -- https://github.com/vinodismyname/RooFlow.git
```

### Creating an Alias

For even easier access, you can create an alias in your shell configuration:

```bash
# Add to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or equivalent:
alias setup-rooflow='curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinodismyname/RooFlow/refs/heads/main/config/setup-roo.sh | bash -s -- https://github.com/vinodismyname/RooFlow.git'
```

After adding this alias and reloading your shell configuration (`source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`), you can simply run:

```bash
setup-rooflow
```

### Manual Setup Options

If you prefer more control, you can also:

1. Download the setup script:
```bash
curl -o setup-roo.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinodismyname/RooFlow/refs/heads/main/config/setup-roo.sh
chmod +x setup-roo.sh
```

2. Run with options:
```bash
# Local mode (using local files)
./setup-roo.sh

# Remote mode (clone from repository)
./setup-roo.sh https://github.com/vinodismyname/RooFlow.git

# Force override existing settings
./setup-roo.sh https://github.com/vinodismyname/RooFlow.git --override
```

### Setup Options

- `--override`: Force overwrite of existing .roo directory
- `--help`: Show usage information

## ðŸ”¹ Amazon Brazil Integration

This fork adds specialized features for Amazon internal development environments:

### Brazil Workspace Guidelines

A  YAML reference is included that provides Roo Code with extensive knowledge about:

- Brazil package structure and configuration
- Essential Brazil commands for workspace management
- Build system configuration
- Testing frameworks
- Common issues and solutions

This allows Roo Code to provide better assistance when working in Amazon Brazil environments.

### Automatic Workspace Context

When operating inside a Brazil workspace, system prompts are automatically populated with:

- Brazil workspace root location
- Available packages in the workspace
- Build system configuration
- Reference to the included guidelines

## ðŸ”¹ System Configuration

The enhanced system prompt configuration is more flexible and adapts to your environment:

```yaml
system_information:
  os: "macOS 14.4.1"
  shell: "bash"
  home_directory: "/Users/username"
  working_directory:
    # Brazil workspace specific information when detected
    workspace_guidelines: "/path/to/brazil-workspace-guidelines.yml"
    brazil_workspace_root: "/path/to/workspace"
    brazil_workspace_packages:
      package1: "/path/to/workspace/src/package1"
      package2: "/path/to/workspace/src/package2"
  initial_context: "Recursive file list in working directory provided in environment_details"
```

## ðŸ”¹ Directory Structure

Your project structure will look like this after setup:

```
project-root/
â”œâ”€â”€ .roo/
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ system-prompt-architect
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ system-prompt-ask
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ system-prompt-code
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ system-prompt-debug
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ system-prompt-test
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ brazil-workspace-guidelines.yml (if in Brazil workspace)
â”œâ”€â”€ .clinerules-architect
â”œâ”€â”€ .clinerules-code
â”œâ”€â”€ .clinerules-ask
â”œâ”€â”€ .clinerules-debug
â”œâ”€â”€ .clinerules-test
â”œâ”€â”€ .rooignore
â”œâ”€â”€ .roomodes
â”œâ”€â”€ memory-bank/ (created automatically)
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ activeContext.md
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ decisionLog.md
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ productContext.md
â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ progress.md
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ systemPatterns.md
â””â”€â”€ projectBrief.md (optional)
```

## ðŸ”¹ Basic Usage

The core functionality remains consistent with the original RooFlow. For detailed information on the Memory Bank system and its features, please refer to the [original RooFlow repository](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/RooFlow).

### Brazil-Specific Commands

When working in a Brazil workspace, Roo Code will have access to key Brazil commands and can help with:

- Creating and managing Brazil workspaces
- Building packages with various options
- Resolving dependency conflicts
- Executing tests with specific configurations
- Navigating package structures


## ðŸ”¹ Acknowledgements
